    <p>The film is definitely a free and open media, but we don't yet have a cheap/free CDN to host the files.</p>
    <p>Primarily, we're going to try <a href="http://xiph.org" title="The Xiph Open Source Community" target="_blank">xiph.org</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.archive.org" title="Internet Archive" target="_blank">archive.org</a> &mdash; but if you have any other/better suggestion (or have a personal hosting you could allow us to use as a mirror), we'd be delighted!</p>
    <p>We will try to update the content of this page as soon as possible &mdash; promise!</p>
