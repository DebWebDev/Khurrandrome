    <p>Khurrandrome is a Sci-Fi VFX-thriller made by a bunch of final year animation students at MAAC, Siliguri. The project was first conceptualized as a 10min VFX short, which later expanded as a full-featured film as we progressed.</p>
    <p>The primary intention behind this film was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism" title="Wiki - Autodidacticism" target="_blank">self-teach</a> ourselves the entire process of film production, practically, by trial and error strategy. There wasn't any plan for marketting or gaining profit - there wasn't any resource to be spent on publicity. With just one Hi-8 DV camera the entire recorded part of the film was shot.</p>
    <p>The group that formed during the creation of the film, were then known as the "Team of Tomorrow" (ToT), consisting the core members who took the massiveness of the project with utmost dedication & succeeded to finally release the film under ToT banner. Among 50+ other MAAC institutes nation-wide, ToT of MAAC Siliguri was the First one to be able to produce an entire feature-length film.</p>
