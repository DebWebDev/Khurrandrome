    <p>Khurrandrome is a Sci-Fi VFX-thriller made by a bunch of final year animation students at MAAC, Siliguri, in 2009.</p>
    <p>The primary goal was to produce a ~10min VFX short (that later expanded as a feature-film), with an intention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism" title="Wiki - Autodidacticism" target="_blank">self-teach</a> ourselves the entire process of film production, with the limited resources we had (one hi-8 handycam, a green-screen &amp; a few 'personal' computers).</p>
    <p>For the release  banner, a group was thus formed, then known as the "<a href="http://www.samsaptak.org" title="Now, Samsaptak!" target="_blank">Team of Tomorrow</a>" (ToT) - and, among the 50+ other MAAC institutes nation-wide, ToT of MAAC Siliguri was the first (&amp; so far, is the only) group to be able to produce an entire feature-length film.</p>
